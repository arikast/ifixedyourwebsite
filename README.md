# The Idea
Some websites are just so laughably busted that you feel compelled to offer an alternative.
This is a collection of these alternatives, which are showcased on [ifixedyourcode.com](http://ifixedyourwebsite.com).

## What precisely elevates a website's dysfunction to the level of "laughable"?  

    1. The website has severely irritating problems
    2. These problems are trivially easy to fix

When both these conditions are met, then the website is "laughably busted".

Contributions are welcome.  Be sure to include a "whatifixed.md" file describing why your version is better than the original.
