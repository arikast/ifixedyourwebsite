# The Idea
Some websites are just so laughably busted that you feel compelled to offer an alternative.
This is a collection of these alternatives.

## What precisely elevate's a website's dysfunction to the level of "laughable"?  

    1. the website has severely irritating problems
    2. these problems are trivially easy to fix

When both these conditions are met, then the website is "laughably busted".
